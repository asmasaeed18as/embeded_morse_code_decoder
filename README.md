# embeded_morse_code_decoder
This project presents the design and implementation of a Morse Code Decoder and Learner using an Arduino microcontroller with output displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen. The primary objective is to create a user-friendly device that allows individuals to input Morse code through tactile buttons and receive real-time visual feedback of the decoded .
The system utilizes three buttons to represent dots, dashes, and spaces, which are the fundamental components of Morse code.
The device is programmed to interpret sequences of button presses, convert them into corresponding alphanumeric characters, and display the results on the LCD. Additionally, special Morse code sequences are implemented to enable functions such as deleting the last character or clearing the entire text. This feature enhances the usability and learning experience, making it an effective educational tool for those learning Morse code.
The hardware setup includes an Arduino microcontroller, a 16x2 LCD display, and three input buttons. The software is developed using the Arduino IDE, incorporating libraries for I2C communication and LCD control. This project not only serves as a practical application of microprocessor systems but also as an engaging educational device to facilitate the learning of Morse code. The simplicity and interactivity of the system provide a compelling way to understand and practice Morse code, making it accessible to both beginners and enthusiasts.
